            Review this pull request for the requirements-expert Claude Code plugin.

            ## Context
            - Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
            - PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
            - Author: ${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}

            ## Instructions
            1. Get the PR diff to understand what changed
            2. Review the changes against the criteria below
            3. Post a summary comment with your findings

            ## Review Criteria

            ### Plugin Components (if changed)
            - **Commands** (`commands/*.md`): Verify YAML frontmatter has name, description, allowed-tools. Check for imperative voice ("Do X" not "You should do X").
            - **Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`): Check trigger phrases in description, version in frontmatter, progressive disclosure pattern.
            - **Agents** (`agents/*.md`): Verify <example> blocks for triggering, appropriate tool restrictions.
            - **Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`): Validate event types and matcher patterns.

            ### Markdown Quality
            - ATX-style headers (`#` not underlines)
            - Dash-style lists (`-` not `*` or `+`)
            - 2-space indentation for nested lists
            - Fenced code blocks (not indented)

            ### GitHub CLI Patterns (if applicable)
            - Projects use `--owner` not `--repo` (projects are owner-scoped)
            - Use project number (integer) not GraphQL ID

            ### Documentation
            - README.md updates if user-facing changes
            - CLAUDE.md updates if development process changes

            ## Output Format
            Post a PR comment with your review. Structure it as:
            1. **Summary**: One-line assessment (looks good / needs changes / has concerns)
            2. **What's Good**: Positive aspects of the PR
            3. **Suggestions**: Improvements or issues found (if any)
            4. **Checklist Verification**: Confirm key items are addressed

            Be constructive and helpful. Focus on significant issues, not nitpicks.
            If the PR looks good, say so briefly - don't invent problems.
