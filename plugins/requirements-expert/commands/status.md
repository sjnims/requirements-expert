# Requirements Project Status

Display a comprehensive overview of the requirements project including counts, progress, priorities, validation status, and recent activity.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Project Data

1. **Get Project Info:**
   - Use `gh project list --owner [owner] --format json`
   - Identify the requirements project
   - Get project URL and metadata

2. **Retrieve All Items:**
   - Use `gh project item-list [project-number] --format json`
   - Get full details including custom fields (Type, Priority, Status)

3. **Categorize by Type:**
   - Vision: Count and status
   - Epics: Count, priorities, status
   - Stories: Count, priorities, status, parent epic
   - Tasks: Count, priorities, status, parent story

4. **Get Recent Activity:**
   - Use `gh issue list --repo [repo] --label type:epic,type:story,type:task --limit 10 --json number,title,updatedAt,state`
   - Show last updated items

### Step 2: Calculate Metrics

**Counts by Type:**
- Total Vision issues (should be 1)
- Total Epics
- Total Stories
- Total Tasks

**Progress by Status:**
- Not Started: [Count] ([%]%)
- In Progress: [Count] ([%]%)
- Completed: [Count] ([%]%)

**Priority Distribution:**
- Must Have: [Count] ([%]%)
- Should Have: [Count] ([%]%)
- Could Have: [Count] ([%]%)
- Won't Have: [Count] ([%]%)

**Completion Metrics:**
- Epics: [X] of [Total] completed ([%]%)
- Stories: [X] of [Total] completed ([%]%)
- Tasks: [X] of [Total] completed ([%]%)

**Velocity (if applicable):**
- Tasks completed in last 7 days
- Stories completed in last 30 days

### Step 3: Generate Status Dashboard

Display comprehensive status:

```

## 💡 Recommendations

[Based on status, provide actionable suggestions]

**Immediate Actions:**
[If no vision:] Run `/re:discover-vision` to create vision
[If no epics:] Run `/re:identify-epics` to identify major capabilities
[If epics not prioritized:] Run `/re:prioritize` to rank epics
[If highest priority epic has no stories:] Run `/re:create-stories` to break down top epic
[If highest priority story has no tasks:] Run `/re:create-tasks` to create implementation tasks

**Health Issues:**
[If validation issues:] Run `/re:review` to identify and fix issues
[If too many In Progress:] Focus on completing work before starting new items
[If progress stalled:] Review blockers and dependencies

### Step 4: Provide Context-Aware Guidance

Based on the status, provide specific next steps:

**If just starting (no vision):**
```
🚀 Getting Started

Your requirements project is newly initialized!

Next Steps:
1. Run `/re:discover-vision` to define your product vision
2. Then `/re:identify-epics` to identify major capabilities
3. Use `/re:prioritize` to rank epics
4. Start implementing highest-priority epics

Estimated time to complete vision + epics: 1-2 hours
```

**If vision exists but few epics:**
```
📝 Vision Defined - Define Epics Next

You have a solid vision. Time to break it down!

Next Steps:
1. Run `/re:identify-epics` to identify 5-12 major capabilities
2. Prioritize epics with `/re:prioritize`
3. Create stories for top epic with `/re:create-stories`
```

**If epics exist but few stories:**
```
🎯 Epics Identified - Create Stories

You have [N] epics. Let's create user stories!

Focus: [Highest priority epic name]

Next Steps:
1. Run `/re:create-stories` for epic #[num]
2. Prioritize stories with `/re:prioritize`
3. Create tasks for top story with `/re:create-tasks`
```

**If well underway:**
```
💪 In Full Swing - Keep the Momentum!

Progress: [X]% complete

Current Focus: [In progress items]

Next Steps:
1. Complete in-progress items
2. Run `/re:status` regularly to track progress
3. Run `/re:review` weekly for quality checks
```

**If near complete:**
```
🎉 Almost There!

You're [X]% complete - great progress!

Remaining Work:
- [N] epics to complete
- [N] stories to finish
- [N] tasks remaining

Keep going! Run `/re:status` to track final progress.
```

### Step 5: Export Option

Offer to export status report:

```
Would you like to export this status report?

I can save it as:
- Markdown file (status-report-[date].md)

- Both

[Use AskUserQuestion for choice]
```

If user wants export, create the file or add comment as requested.
