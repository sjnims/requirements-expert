# Prioritization Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

This reference provides detailed guidance on prioritization best practices and common pitfalls to avoid. Load this when conducting prioritization sessions or reviewing prioritization decisions.

For the core MoSCoW framework and prioritization process, see the main skill documentation.

## Best Practices

### Challenge "Must Haves"

Everything feels critical to someone:

- Use strict criteria: "Product is broken without this"
- Push back on inflated urgency
- Ask: "Can we ship an MVP without this?"
- Aim to keep "Must Haves" under 60%

### Be Explicit About "Won't Haves"

Prevent scope creep:

- Document what's explicitly out of scope
- Explain why (not aligned, too costly, wrong time)
- Revisit in future planning cycles
- Helps manage stakeholder expectations

### Consider Technical Dependencies

Priority isn't just about value:

- Some items must come before others (architecture, data model)
- Foundation before features built on it
- Don't prioritize item X high if it depends on low-priority item Y

### Revisit and Refine

Priorities change:

- New information emerges
- Market conditions shift
- User feedback reveals new priorities
- Re-prioritize at regular intervals (quarterly, per release)

### Involve Stakeholders

Prioritization is collaborative:

- Product owners provide business perspective
- Developers provide technical perspective
- Users/customers provide value perspective
- Build consensus on trade-offs

### Use Data When Available

Inform decisions with evidence:

- Usage analytics (what features are used most?)
- User research (what do users need most?)
- Revenue data (what drives business value?)
- Competitor analysis (what's table stakes?)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Everything is a "Must Have"

If everything is critical, nothing is:

- Challenge assumptions
- Force trade-offs
- Use strict criteria for "Must Have"

### Ignoring Technical Dependencies

Prioritizing features without considering what they depend on:

- Map dependencies
- Prioritize prerequisites appropriately
- Consider architectural foundations

### Forgetting "Won't Have"

Scope creep occurs when exclusions aren't explicit:

- Actively identify what's out of scope
- Document and communicate "Won't Haves"
- Revisit them in future planning

### Prioritizing Based on Who Shouts Loudest

Let the loudest voice determine priority:

- Use objective criteria
- Base decisions on data and strategy
- Build consensus across stakeholders

### Never Re-Prioritizing

Priorities set once and never revisited:

- Revisit priorities regularly
- Adjust based on new information
- Stay flexible and adaptive

## Quick Reference: Warning Signs

| Warning Sign | What to Do |
|--------------|------------|
| >60% Must Haves | Challenge each: "Can we really not ship without this?" |
| No Won't Haves | Explicitly identify out-of-scope items |
| High-priority depends on low-priority | Elevate prerequisite or lower dependent |
| Loudest voice wins | Apply objective criteria, seek data |
| Priorities never change | Schedule regular re-prioritization reviews |
