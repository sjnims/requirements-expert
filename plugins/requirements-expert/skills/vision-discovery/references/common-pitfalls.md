# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

This reference provides detailed guidance on common vision discovery pitfalls and how to avoid them. Load this when reviewing vision documents for quality or when helping users troubleshoot vision definition issues.

For the core vision discovery process, see the main skill documentation.

## ❌ Too Vague

Vague visions fail to provide direction because they could apply to almost anything.

**Signs of a vague vision:**

- ❌ "Build a platform for users to interact"
- ❌ "Create a solution that helps businesses"
- ❌ "Improve the user experience"
- ❌ Generic language that could describe any product

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|----------|-------------|
| "Help users manage data" | "Enable marketing managers to track campaign ROI across 10+ channels in real-time" |
| "Build a better tool" | "Reduce manual data reconciliation time from 3 hours/week to 15 minutes" |
| "Improve collaboration" | "Allow distributed teams to co-edit documents with real-time presence indicators" |

**How to fix:**

- ✅ Name specific user roles (not just "users")
- ✅ Quantify the problem where possible (time, money, frequency)
- ✅ Describe observable outcomes
- ✅ Use concrete examples to illustrate the vision

**Why this matters:**

- Vague visions provide no scope boundaries
- Teams interpret vague visions differently, causing alignment issues
- Impossible to measure success against vague criteria

## ❌ Too Prescriptive

Prescriptive visions constrain solutions before the problem is fully understood.

**Signs of a prescriptive vision:**

- ❌ "Build a React app with a dashboard showing charts"
- ❌ "Create a mobile app that uses AI"
- ❌ "Implement a microservices architecture"
- ❌ Technology choices embedded in vision

| ❌ Prescriptive | ✅ Outcome-Focused |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Build a React dashboard with pie charts" | "Provide visibility into campaign performance to enable data-driven decisions" |
| "Create a mobile app with push notifications" | "Enable users to stay informed about important updates wherever they are" |
| "Use machine learning to analyze data" | "Surface actionable insights from large datasets without manual analysis" |

**How to fix:**

- ✅ Focus on outcomes, not implementations
- ✅ Describe what users can do, not how it's built
- ✅ Leave technology decisions for later discovery
- ✅ Answer "what" and "why," not "how"

**Why this matters:**

- Prescriptive visions eliminate better solutions before they're considered
- Technology choices should follow from requirements, not precede them
- Implementation details change; user needs remain more stable

## ❌ Scope Creep

Scope creep visions try to be everything to everyone, losing focus.

**Signs of scope creep:**

- ❌ Vision includes e-commerce, social, analytics, AI, blockchain, mobile, desktop...
- ❌ "And also" appears frequently in vision description
- ❌ No explicit exclusions or boundaries
- ❌ Vision would take years to fully realize

| ❌ Scope Creep | ✅ Focused |
|---------------|-----------|
| "Full-featured marketing suite with email, social, analytics, CRM, and automation" | "Campaign ROI tracking platform (NOT creative design or email delivery)" |
| "Complete business management platform" | "Invoice management for freelancers (NOT accounting, NOT project management)" |

**How to fix:**

- ✅ Define explicit scope boundaries (what's included AND excluded)
- ✅ Identify the single most important user need
- ✅ Use "NOT" statements to clarify exclusions
- ✅ Ask: "What is the one thing this must do well?"

**Why this matters:**

- Unfocused visions dilute resources across too many priorities
- Teams can't prioritize when everything is "in scope"
- Shipping anything becomes impossible

## ❌ Unmeasurable Success

Visions with unmeasurable success criteria can never be validated.

**Signs of unmeasurable success:**

- ❌ "Be the best product in the market"
- ❌ "Delight users"
- ❌ "Improve efficiency"
- ❌ "Get lots of users"

| ❌ Unmeasurable | ✅ Measurable |
|----------------|--------------|
| "Be the best product" | "Achieve 10,000 active users with 70%+ weekly retention within 12 months" |
| "Improve efficiency" | "Reduce task completion time from 15 minutes to 2 minutes" |
| "Get lots of users" | "Acquire 1,000 paying customers within 6 months of launch" |
| "Delight users" | "Achieve NPS score of 50+ within first year" |

**How to fix:**

- ✅ Apply SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- ✅ Define specific numerical targets
- ✅ Include timeframes for achieving targets
- ✅ Distinguish between leading and lagging indicators

**Why this matters:**

- Without measurable goals, there's no way to know if the vision is achieved
- Unmeasurable goals prevent data-driven decision making
- Teams can't course-correct without feedback

## ❌ Missing User Focus

Visions without clear user definition build products for nobody.

**Signs of missing user focus:**

- ❌ Users described as "everyone" or "businesses"
- ❌ No specific user personas or roles
- ❌ User goals and pain points not articulated
- ❌ Vision focuses on features, not user outcomes

| ❌ Missing User Focus | ✅ User-Centered |
|----------------------|------------------|
| "For users who need analytics" | "For marketing managers at mid-size B2B companies who need to track campaign ROI" |
| "Help businesses grow" | "Help e-commerce store owners with $1M-$10M revenue optimize their ad spend" |
| "A platform for data" | "Data analysts who spend 3+ hours weekly manually compiling reports from multiple sources" |

**How to fix:**

- ✅ Create specific user personas with roles, context, and goals
- ✅ Identify primary and secondary user types
- ✅ Document user pain points with specific examples
- ✅ Validate user understanding with actual user research

**Why this matters:**

- Products built for "everyone" satisfy no one
- Specific users enable prioritization decisions
- User research validates assumptions before building

## ❌ Solution Before Problem

Jumping to solutions before understanding the problem leads to building the wrong thing.

**Signs of solution-first thinking:**

- ❌ Vision starts with "Build a..." instead of "Enable users to..."
- ❌ Problem statement is retrofitted to justify a solution
- ❌ "5 Whys" analysis was not performed
- ❌ Competitive analysis focused on features, not user needs

| ❌ Solution-First | ✅ Problem-First |
|------------------|------------------|
| "Build a dashboard" | "Users can't see their campaign performance across channels" |
| "We need an app" | "Field workers can't access critical information when away from desk" |
| "Implement AI chatbot" | "Support team can't handle volume of repetitive questions" |

**How to fix:**

- ✅ Start with problem discovery before solution discussion
- ✅ Use "5 Whys" technique to find root causes
- ✅ Validate the problem exists before designing solutions
- ✅ Ensure the problem statement doesn't assume a solution

**Why this matters:**

- The best solution may not be what was initially imagined
- Understanding the problem opens up alternative solutions
- Problem-first approach reduces risk of building the wrong thing
