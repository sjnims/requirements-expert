# Success Metrics Examples

This reference provides examples of well-crafted success metrics for product visions. Use these examples when defining the Success Metrics section of your vision document to ensure metrics are specific, measurable, and meaningful.

---

## Overview

Success metrics define how you'll know the product is delivering value. Vague metrics like "improve efficiency" or "increase satisfaction" don't provide actionable guidance. Instead, use the SMART framework to create metrics that drive decisions.

---

## The SMART Framework

Every success metric should be:

| Criterion | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **S**pecific | Clearly defined, no ambiguity | "Daily active users" not "user engagement" |
| **M**easurable | Quantifiable with available data | "70% retention" not "good retention" |
| **A**chievable | Realistic given constraints | "10K users in 12 months" for a new product |
| **R**elevant | Connected to product value | "Time saved" for a productivity tool |
| **T**ime-bound | Has a deadline | "within 6 months" not "eventually" |

### SMART vs. Non-SMART Examples

| Non-SMART (Avoid) | SMART (Use) |
|-------------------|-------------|
| "Get lots of users" | "Acquire 10,000 active users within 12 months" |
| "Improve customer satisfaction" | "Achieve NPS score of 50+ within 6 months" |
| "Be faster than competitors" | "Reduce report generation time from 4 hours to 15 minutes" |
| "Increase revenue" | "Reach $500K ARR within 18 months" |

---

## Metric Categories

Structure your metrics around three categories to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### 1. Adoption Metrics

Measure whether users are signing up and starting to use the product.

| Metric | What It Measures | Good For |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Total registered users | Awareness and interest | B2C, freemium products |
| Activated users | Users who complete onboarding | Products with setup friction |
| Time to first value | How quickly users see benefit | Complex products |
| Conversion rate | Free to paid, trial to subscribe | SaaS, subscription products |

**Example Adoption Metrics:**

- "Achieve 5,000 registered users within 6 months"
- "80% of new signups complete onboarding within 24 hours"
- "Reduce time to first dashboard from 30 minutes to 5 minutes"
- "15% trial-to-paid conversion rate within 9 months"

---

### 2. Engagement Metrics

Measure whether users continue to find value and return to the product.

| Metric | What It Measures | Good For |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Daily/Weekly/Monthly active users (DAU/WAU/MAU) | Regular usage patterns | Any product |
| Retention rate | Users returning over time | Subscription, recurring-use products |
| Session frequency | How often users engage | Productivity tools, content platforms |
| Feature adoption | Usage of specific capabilities | Complex products with many features |

**Example Engagement Metrics:**

- "Achieve 70% weekly retention (WAU/MAU ratio) within 6 months"
- "Average user logs in 3+ times per week"
- "60% of users use the reporting feature monthly"
- "DAU/MAU ratio of 40%+ indicating daily habit formation"

---

### 3. Outcome Metrics

Measure whether the product delivers its promised value—the "so what?" of the vision.

| Metric | What It Measures | Good For |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Time saved | Efficiency gains | Productivity, automation tools |
| Error reduction | Quality improvement | Data, process management tools |
| Cost reduction | Financial impact | Operations, business tools |
| Revenue generated | Direct business value | Sales, marketing, e-commerce tools |
| User success rate | Task completion | Any product with defined workflows |

**Example Outcome Metrics:**

- "Users report saving 5+ hours per week on manual tasks"
- "Reduce data entry errors by 80%"
- "Customers achieve 20% reduction in operational costs"
- "85% task completion rate for core workflows"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Vanity Metrics

Metrics that look good but don't indicate real value:

| Vanity Metric | Why It's Problematic | Better Alternative |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Total signups | Includes inactive, churned users | Active users, retention rate |
| Page views | Doesn't indicate value delivered | Task completion, time to value |
| Total downloads | App may be uninstalled immediately | 30-day retention |
| Feature releases | Output, not outcome | Feature adoption rate |

---

### Unmeasurable Aspirations

Goals that sound good but can't be tracked:

| Unmeasurable | Why It's Problematic | Better Alternative |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Be the best in market" | No objective definition | "Achieve higher NPS than top competitor" |
| "Delight users" | Subjective, unmeasurable | "Achieve NPS of 50+" |
| "Revolutionary product" | Not a metric | "Reduce time-to-task by 80% vs. alternatives" |
| "Industry leader" | Vague aspiration | "Capture 15% market share in segment" |

---

### Missing Timeframes

Metrics without deadlines enable indefinite deferral:

| Missing Timeframe | Better Alternative |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Achieve 10,000 users" | "Achieve 10,000 users within 12 months" |
| "High retention" | "70% weekly retention within 6 months" |
| "Positive ROI" | "Achieve positive unit economics by month 18" |

---

### Misaligned Metrics

Metrics that don't connect to user value:

| Misaligned | Why It's Problematic | Better Alternative |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Revenue only | Ignores user success | Include user outcome metrics alongside revenue |
| Engineering velocity | Measures output, not value | Feature adoption, user success rate |
| Marketing spend efficiency | Internal metric | Customer acquisition cost relative to LTV |

---

## Structuring Metrics in Vision Documents

Use a table format for clarity:

```markdown
### Success Metrics

**How we'll measure success:**

| Metric | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Active paying customers | 500 | 12 months |
| Weekly retention rate | 85%+ | 6 months |
| Time saved per user | 8+ hours/week | 3 months |
| NPS score | 50+ | 6 months |

**User Success Indicators:**

- Connect 3+ data sources (indicates meaningful adoption)
- Log in weekly or more (indicates ongoing value)
- Share dashboards with stakeholders (indicates solving core pain)
```

---

## Metrics Selection Checklist

When choosing metrics for your vision, ensure:

- [ ] **Balance:** Mix of adoption, engagement, and outcome metrics
- [ ] **User-centric:** At least one metric measures user success, not just business success
- [ ] **Measurable:** Each metric can be tracked with available or planned tooling
- [ ] **Timebound:** Each metric has a clear deadline
- [ ] **Prioritized:** 3-5 metrics maximum to maintain focus
- [ ] **Leading indicators:** Include early signals, not just lagging outcomes

---

## Quick Reference

| Metric Type | Measures | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Adoption | Are users signing up and starting? | "5,000 users in 6 months" |
| Engagement | Are users coming back? | "70% weekly retention" |
| Outcome | Is the product delivering value? | "Save 8+ hours/week" |
| Business | Is the product viable? | "$250K ARR in 12 months" |

### SMART Checklist

| Letter | Question | Pass/Fail |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| S | Is it specific and unambiguous? | |
| M | Can we measure it with data? | |
| A | Is the target realistic? | |
| R | Does it connect to product value? | |
| T | Does it have a deadline? | |
