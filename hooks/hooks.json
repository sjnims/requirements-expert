Would you like to use the requirements-expert plugin to help structure this work? It can guide you through vision → epics → stories → tasks using GitHub Projects.\n```\n\nIf the message is not related to requirements work, respond with an empty string.\n\nIMPORTANT: Only suggest the plugin when it's clearly relevant. Don't suggest for:\n- General coding questions\n- Debugging existing code\n- Simple feature requests that don't need full requirements process\n- Questions about how things work",
